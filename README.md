# Filter-React-Vue-ES8

Little data filtering workshop with a friends, easy to use, even in stand-alone without any framework !
In the differents folder we have an example to do it with React or Vue, feel free to compare and pick the best one haha
I like Vue for the simplicity but with React we have more control (just my though).

### Installing
Just clone this repo:

```
git clone git@github.com:CMarzin/Filter-React-Vue-ES8.git
```

Go to the specific folder

```
# React
cd React-filter

# Vue
cd Vue-filter
```
Install everything with `npm` and start the project:

```
# npm
npm i
npm start
```

Special Thanks to https://github.com/CharlesMangwa for the react part ! 
You rock !
